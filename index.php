					Hi. I'm Matthew Maravilla. I'm also known as Clodial</br>
					and I have a deep passion for the way we design and</br>
					create media. I specialize in game design and</br>
					development while getting my hands dirty in web design</br>
					and web development.</br></br>
					I got my start with a simple "Hello World" in</br>
					Visual Basic when I was a highschool junior. At that</br>
					point, I became hooked and started focusing on making</br>
					games and I even competed in several high school</br>
					contests like the Technology Student's Association.

				<p>
					As a college student, I have participated in a myriad</br>
					of game jams and game events like the Global Game Jam,</br>
					Ludum Dare, and IndieCade East.</br></br>
					As a designer, I feel that what I make can speak.</br>
					There are underlying stories to our creations that need</br>
					just letting out. As creators, I believe we have</br>
					responsibilities to the people who use our websites, games,</br>
					books, and all other forms of art to tell the world about</br>
					who we are. Being cooped up behind a computer might feel</br>
					lonely but being able to hear from others makes this whole</br>
					journey something worth trekking.
